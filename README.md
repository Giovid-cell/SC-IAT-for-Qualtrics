# SC-IAT-for-Qualtrics
This topic aims to convert IAT code for Qualtrics in Sc-IAT

Following the iatgen coding, we are trying to convert the IAT code in the SC-IAT from Karpinsky and Steinman (2006). We want to use the SC-IAT on Qualtrics. Before addressing this topic we reccommend to read the work of iatgen and their paper that you can find here open source (https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01293-3). We are using their exact code on R
